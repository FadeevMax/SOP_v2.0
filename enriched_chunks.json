If it is something out of that, it will be communicated in the menu or email. They usually create the promo prices on Monday, and those rules are created in LT within a maximum of 24 hours. That is the gap when prices on the menu are not reflected in LT, and we have to adjust them manually.\nPRIORITY ORDERS: Rise is having priority over regular orders (if they come late Wed, early Thu). They hold with regular orders until the rise is in.\nThere are 5 rise stores: Cleveland, Detroit, Madison, Lorain and Toledo.\nIt is split by delivery dates but inputted at the same time.\nComes on Thursday AM - they punch them for delivery next week\nPRICING: For rise orders, we follow the MENU pricing. Menu prices should be the same as LT prices; if not, follow the menu price and make a note.\nDISCOUNT: They have special discounts for some SKUs. They provide this info in the body of the email when they send a rise. Usually, these discounts are already included in the menu and LT, however we can always double-check.\nImage 1.

In such cases, we should manually adjust the price and make a note about it (e.g., for Beboe gummies $10).\nImage 1. Actual price column\nImage 2. Special deals\nPRICE CHANGE WHEN ITEM IS OOS: Since pricing depends on the number of products ordered, if some items are out of stock and the order no longer qualifies for the lower price tier, we should apply the higher price and inform the reps when sending the invoice. Explanation:\nImage 3. Bucket price change\nBATCH/PULL NOT AVAILABLE: In case the requested batch is not available, GO TO - Inventory/Pricing - Search the product by name - check expiration date first. If multiple batches have the same exp date, the second step would be to search for the lowest pull no (last 4 digits / in case there are 0000, then it might be 5 digits)\nImage 4.

If there is no other batch available, we will pick these 20 units and send a note via email\nSUBS - If the batch is not available, we substitute with a different batch number according to the rules. If the other batch is not available, we don't substitute with different products; we just advise the rep in the email about OOS\nBATTERIES: Batteries are going on a separate invoice\nOFF-SPEC PRODUCTS: If we notice that the product has an Off spec in the batch name, we should avoid adding it to the regular orders. We use these only for RISE stores.\nImage 7. OFF SPEC products\nIf we have a situation where there is a request for 15 units of Good Green 28.3g - we should add 10 or 20 units and add that info in the email (because of the case size)\nCASE SIZE EXCEPTION: Only in the case of fewer available units (with no other batch to substitute), we can break the case. For example, if there are only 14 units left of Good Green 28.3g and we have a request for 20, we will not pull 10 (1 case), but we will pull all 14 and close that batch, notifying them in the email.\nORDER CHECK: In the first tab, we have the summary where we can check if everything is correct after we are done with the order.\nImage 7. 2nd step - Order summary",

However, if only 6 units are available, we will not fulfill the request - just mark the product as OOS\nSPLITTING THE PRODUCT: For orders exceeding 300 units of a single product (for example, 16 cases of Animal Face 3.5g), both product size types (cases and loose units) will be used. If a case size is 25 units, a request for 400 units will require 16 cases. We will usually allocate 8 cases + 200 loose units to fulfill the request, two lines. However, we can split the other way if needed, ex. Below\nImage 3. Product split between case and loose units (for requested 300+ units)\nBATCH SPLIT: We can split the batch a maximum of two times in one order if needed (use 2 batches of the same product). We do this in order to close the open batch.\nExample 1: If there is a batch with 50 units left and a batch with 500 units available, and we have a request for 4 cases, we will pull 2 cases from the smaller batch and 2 from the larger.\nExample 2: If there is a batch with 12 units left and we have a request for 50 units (2 cases), we will add those 12 loose units to close the batch, and take the remaining 38 loose units from the second available batch.\nPRIORITY: The store that orders the highest number of units receives priority. Typically, this is Hagerstown!\nSKU LIMITS: We generally follow the maximum SKU number a store can accept (ex., Hagerstown 6000 units). However, if the store orders more, we can still process the order and verify with Manny whether it is acceptable or needs to be adjusted.

They will also send us the flower split. Example:\nImage 6. Flower hold sheet\nThe order where they are holding the units will usually be under the Hagerstown location. Once we find that order in LT, we need to create a new order for Hagerstown, and later for Joppa, SS, and Bethesda. The biggest difference between Rise for Flowers and for other products is that the flowers are saved in advance, and we are moving products to our orders instead of searching for them. So we need to move the SKUs from the main order to the separate orders we created!\nWe open LT in two tabs. In one, we are keeping the main order; in the other, the order that we are building. The order from which we are moving the items doesn\u2019t have to be in add/edit-just open it by clicking on the order number. Once you are ready, you move the items by clicking the three dots on the side, and you choose how many units you want to move (the number is always by item, even if the product is in case size) (e.g., moving 2 cases, you will type 50 units). When you transfer, it will show \"2 cases,\" so no worries. Once you move, refresh the page of the new order and you will see the products. The good thing is, if you make a mistake, you can always transfer the units back to the main order. When you transfer all requested units, you save your new order and download the invoice. Since the main order is not in the add/edit mode, you don\u2019t have to save or anything.\nImage 7. Moving the items step 1\nImage 8. Moving the items step 2\nThe problem arises when we have a request for more than 300 units of one product, as we need both the case and loose size items on the main order, which is usually not the case. Here\u2019s how we handle it: We remove the product from the main order and click save (ALWAYS make a note about the product name, batch, and quantity-so you know what to pull back). Then, we wait for a few minutes before searching for the product again. Once the product is visible, we pull it back into the order, with half the quantity in the case and half in the loose size.\nIf there is no loose size or case size still available, we need to ask Maneth for help. Sometimes he will agree to go with (350, 400 units), but sometimes he will create those for us.\nWe can split the batch a maximum of two times in the order (sometimes you will not have enough units in one batch, so you will use two. That is fine-just make sure to split only two times).\nUsually, the requested number of units is not the same as what is available. Example: request for 2 cases, and there are only 46 units left. That is fine-add as much as you can. Usually, the last store is the one receiving more or less than requested.\nNot enough units: If we have a request for, for example, 395 units across 4 stores (100 each), we will allocate 95 units to one of the stores, usually the last or second-to-last one. If we have more examples like this, we try to divide them between the stores so that not only one store receives these partials.\nNotes example\nImage 9. Notes for flowers",

Only if partial cases are requested, loose units can be used.\nBATTERIES: Batteries must go on a separate invoice.\nCASE SIZE: Always ensure the case size from the menu matches the one selected in LT. Discrepancies are common. If there is a difference, make a note and adjust pricing accordingly based on the case size.\nINTERNAL NOTES: For New Jersey (NJ) orders only, internal notes must be added in LT (Internal Notes).\nImage 1. Internal notes example\nSAMPLE PRODUCTS: If a product is priced at $1, it is considered a sample. These items should not be added to RISE orders. Instead, mark the item as OOS (red) and make a note.\nORDER CHECK: At the top of every tab, there is a total summary. Always refer to it when placing an order. Note: Sometimes the summary formulas are incorrect and do not include all cells, which can cause discrepancies in order totals. If this happens, make a note.\nDISCOUNT: Discounts are listed on the menu. Any additional discounts are communicated via email.\nORDER SPLIT: If an order has more than 50 line items, it must be split accordingly. Example: A RISE order with 150 lines should be split into 3 orders of 50 lines each.\nSAMPLE ORDER: If a request for samples is received (rare), they should be placed as a new order.\nTWO MENU FORMATS: If an NJ order email includes two Excel menus for the same store, combine them into one order in LT.\nNOTES FORMAT: Always follow this format for notes: 0/30 Animal Face 3.5g Rythm 25/50 Brownie Scout 7g Rythm\nCuttoff for order placement is during the time we punch in RISE orders (RISE orders usually come as early as 10 AM and as late as 3 PM)\nNo special order prioritization-FIFO rules-unless its a brand new store, but the rep will specify it.\nSTORES: There are 10 Rise stores (Canton, Charleston, Effingham, Joliet Colorado, Joliet Rock, Lake in the hills, Mundelein, Naperville, Niles, Quincy)\nORDER SPLIT: If the order is above 150k or has more than 8k units, you need to split the order equally.\nBATCH SUB: We always use the batch provided in the menu. If it is OOS we can sub the batch following FIFO and make the note (try to stay within the same THC% tens - eg. 30%, 40% for flowers and prerolls).. If the item is totally OOS, we make a note as well (We do not substitute with different flavours of the same item).\nPRICING: We follow the LT pricing - if not instructed to follow the menu.\nDISCOUNT: RISE orders do not succumb to any discounts\nORDER CHECK: Make sure to double-check the requested number of units and the total number of units in the order (see if they match, including your notes)\nThere might be a second tab on the menu - please check if we should enter those units as well - should be advised in the rise email.\nLOOSE UNITS: We ADD LOOSE UNITS ONLY if that is the last batch (units available)\nCASE SIZE: Case sizes might differ from time to time; make sure to double-check. (They might request a case of 30, but only cases of 25 are available; you can freely add those and make notes about them.)\nLESS AVAILABLE: If we have for example, 2 available cases out of 4 requested (and there is no other batch available) we add those 2 and make a note. If there are 2 cases available, but there is another batch, we pull these 2 cases from the requested batch, and add 2 cases from another batch.

    "chunk_text": "REC VS MED: Please ALWAYS select MED if that's the option\nDISCOUNTS: Most discounts (e.g., 20%, 30%) are already set up in Leaftrade.\nHowever, there are times when we\u2019re asked to apply a discount that isn\u2019t pre-configured in LT.\nIf the discount shown in LT matches what they requested via email, proceed with it and simply include a note with the invoice-for example, \u201c20% discount applied.\u201d\nIf the discount in LT is greater than what was requested (e.g., they asked for 20%, but LT shows 30%), confirm with the rep.\nIf the discount in LT is lower than what was requested (e.g., LT shows 20%, but the rep requested 30%), confirm in the discount doc and with Valerie.\nWhen checking the discount, the best approach is to create a new column with a manual pricing formula - for example: unit price \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 case size\nAdditionally, some SKUs may be on promotion, listed in the \"Promo price\" column. These promo prices may or may not be reflected in LT, so always double-check and apply manually if needed.\nImage 2: Promo price colum\nBATCH SUB - THC% PRIORITY: For flowers and pre-rolls, we prioritize the THC percentage. If the batch with the requested THC% is out of stock, we should make a batch substitution, aiming to stay within the same 10% range (e.g., 20s, 30s, etc.).\nBATCH SUB - FIFO PRIORITY: For all other products (excluding flower and pre-rolls), if the requested batch is out of stock, we make a batch substitution following FIFO.\nBATTERIES: Batteries must go on a separate invoice.\nLOOSE UNITS: We add loose units only if that is the last batch available or if a partial case is requested. We never split a loose unit's batch.\nFor example, if a retailer asks for a partial case and there are two batches - one with 20 units and another with 8 units - we should add either all 20 or all 8 units. We should never take 15 units out of the batch of 20. There is no minimum limit; we can add batch with 2 or 3 units as well.\nImage 3: Loose units rule\nLESS AVAILABLE UNITS: If we receive a request for 2 cases and only 1 case is available, we can fulfill the 1 case and make a note.\nSAMPLES: Samples are placed inside orders not separate from the order but the price rule applies the same ($0.01 per unit)\nORDER CHECK: The order total (in dollars) at the top of the menu is often not accurate, so we verify order accuracy by checking the total number of units instead.\nWe calculate the total units listed in the menu and compare them with the unit total entered in the order to ensure they match.\nIf any items are out of stock, please mark that cell on the excel file in red and send the excel sheet back with the invoices\nMission South Shore - LT: Mission Illinois - South Chicago - REC / MED",

In this case, the &Shine items don\u2019t show for NY as they use andShine name instead of the &Shine. So you would need to adjust that name in the search bar so it comes up.\nImage 7. Product name Search Bar\nNote: If some of the requested products are not available (either completely unavailable or the requested THC % is not available) leave a note with how many units they requested next to the name of the item and how much we have left in stock if any. DO NOT add to order as the sales reps would need to check which products the retailer want to use as substitutes. I.e: Rythm - Cereal Milk #1 - Live Rosin Vape Cartridge - .5g - requested 50\n6. Keep in mind that each product listed represents 1 Case so if you are supposed to add 2 cases of the same product you will have to type in 2 in the Quantity Section if the name contains something that indicates the case size: (a case of 25) this will add 2 of the same products to the order. However, if the retailer wants 30 and the case size is 20, you can add 1 of the 20, and then you will see another item name but without the case size - those are loose items - you can add 10 of the loose ones to match what the retailer requested.\n//**\nImage 8.

This is a group email address that contains all HQ contractors working on the GTI Account.\nWhen the order comes in, please send a Slack message to #gti-salesops slack channel if you are taking responsibility for the order submission.\nMenu in excel format where the retailer has marked which products they want, how many cases & which TAC %. This is the best way to receive orders because it provides the exact Product Name, exact TAC % and case size as well as the Request Summary.\nImage 1. Email containing the menu order form NOTE: always check the time of the order with the hold off on order entry especially for NV as we have times that we can place WS (wholesales) orders.\nImage 2. Order format in order enetry form\nIn email order - Excel table or just a list.This way of receiving orders can be a little bit more complicated because the buyers do not name the products correctly a lot of the time, which results in a bit more time spent searching for the product in Leaf Trade.In this case for NV, the retailers usually ask for different strains from the same product. I.e (125 units of 3.5g Flower Rythm) this means we have to spread the 125 on different strains of the 3.5g Rythm flower.\nImage 4. Example of an In email order\n2. Go to Leaf Trade, Sales-> Account -> GTI NV --> Orders 3. Click New order\n4. Choose a Retailer from the Dropdown menu, the rep will indicate the Store name, location and in most cases if we are sending the order to their Recreational License or Medical License (if they have both) and click Create. NOTE: for NV, we have 3 different stock locations - CULT, PROD and CBX. Most of the time CULT has all flowers and some prerolls. PROD is for prerolls and some vapes. CBX is for vapes, edibles, tinctures and lotions.\nImage 5. Retailer Dropdown in Leaf Trade\nImage 6. Stock location drop down in LT.\n5. Copy & Paste the batch number into the batch or pull field as for NV we search for specific batches instead of names.\nImage 7. Batch or Pull number search field.\nImage 8. Batch or Pull number in the order menu.\nThere are instances where a specific batch is OOS so you would have to delete the batch number from the search field and search by the item name.\nWhen you search by item name, some items usually don\u2019t come up in LeafTrade under the name that is listed in the Menu Order Form and that is because the name does not match what is the item under in the system. In this case, the &Shine items doesn\u2019t show for NY as they use andShine name instead of the &Shine. So you would need to adjust that name in the search bar so it comes up.\nImage 7. Product name Search Bar\nNote: If some of the requested products are not available (either completely unavailable or the requested THC % is not available) leave a note with how many units they requested next to the name of the item and how much we have left in stock if any. We can offer SUBs as long as they meet the following criteria: Same brand (if Rythm has to be Rythm), same species, same or similar THC %.\nWe can always adjust on the items if the rep asks us to remove or change the subs so don\u2019t be afraid about the SUBs you choose.\n6. Keep in mind that each product listed represents 1 Case so if you are supposed to add 2 cases of the same product you will have to type in 2 in the Quantity Section if the name contains something that indicates the case size: (a case of 25) this will add 2 of the same products to the order. However, if the retailer wants 30 and the case size is 20, you can add 1 of the 20, and then you will see another item name but without the case size - those are loose items - you can add 10 of the loose ones to match what the retailer requested.\nImage 8.
